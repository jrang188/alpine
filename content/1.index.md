Hello there! 👋

# description

**My name is Justin Ang. I am a computer science and business student at Simon Fraser University.**
::

I am passionate about bridging technology 💻 and business 📈, and I love building software solutions that improve lives and communities 🚀.

Outside of coding, I enjoy watching professional wrestling and am fond of mechanical keyboards ⌨️. I have been pushing myself to go to the gym 💪. I am also an avid EDM listener 🎧, and I have previously tried DJing, something that I would love to do again at one point. Lastly, I have been delving deeper into coffee brewing ☕ on espresso and pour-overs.

Thank you for visiting my page. Feel free to reach out by emailing <justin_ang_2@sfu.ca> or connecting through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jrang188/). I look forward to connecting with you!
