[MindfulU](https://nw-hacks-2023.vercel.app/) centralizes information on mental health services offered by UBC, SFU, and other organizations. It assists students in finding, learning about, and using mental health resources through features like a chatbot, meditation mode, and an interactive services map. Through this project, our team was one of the finalist of the [NWHacks 2023](https://nwplus.io/#hackathons) Hackathon at the University of British Columbia.
