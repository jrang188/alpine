[Scrappy](https://sfuscrappy.web.app//) is a web app designed to aggregate information on courses at SFU and display them in a user-friendly and intuitive way. In this 6 months project, I spearheaded the development of the course page using Vue, Tailwind CSS, and Vuetify, resulting in a significantly improved user experience.
