Developed a hospital management platform for [Hope Health Action (HHA)](https://hopehealthaction.org/) to be used in Haiti to manage their hospital and healthcare initiatives. The platform's main features are departmental report generation, broken equipment tracking, employee of the month management, message board, and case study management. This platform aims to reduce the amount of paperwork and manual data entry required by the hospital staff.

## Role

In this project, I was the product owner, coordinating with clients and identifying requirements for the platform. I also worked on frontend, especially the Report Generation Forms, ensuring that the forms are modular and easily customizable for future use. I also worked on the backend, setting up the connection to connection to send logs to Grafana Loki. In addition, I developed the necessary seeder script to set up the MongoDB database in the production environment. I also worked on setting up the Grafana dashboard to monitor the platform. Lastly, I also debugged the docker-compose file to ensure robustness for production deployment.
